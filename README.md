# Parabola - Site
This is the repo for the official PARABOLA website. Feel free to fork it or study it for your own purposes. It was 
built using Vue.js and Gridsome.

To work from it, you'll need to install the Gridsome CLI tool:
```
npm install --global @gridsome/cli
```

Once you've done that, clone the repo into the folder of your choice and install the dependencies:
```
git clone git@github.com:thoughtreactordm/parabola-site.git parabola
cd parabola
npm install
```

## Contributions
Short of some breaking bug or security flaw, we are not going to be taking in pull requests for features. This repo 
is open source so other developers may learn from it or clone it as a starter kit for a similarly styled video game 
website.
